# BDBT Project Specification

## Project Overview
BDBT (Business Development Business Tips) - An autonomous content generation and management system that creates, processes, and distributes business tips 24/7.

## Core Objectives
1. Generate 50-100 high-quality business tips daily using Grok AI
2. Maintain a Supabase database of all tips with categories and metadata
3. Generate professional PDFs for each tip with branding
4. Provide web interface for tip management and export
5. Enable Canva integration for social media content creation

## System Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **AI Integration**: Grok API for tip generation
- **PDF Generation**: Custom React PDF service
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Current State
- Basic tip generation workflow implemented
- Database schema created with tips, categories, and metadata tables
- PDF generation service functional
- Multiple app variants exist (minimal-app, clean-app, core-app)
- Canva integration partially implemented

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (2 hours)
- [ ] Fix TypeScript errors in main build
- [ ] Ensure all database operations are working
- [ ] Test tip generation with Grok API
- [ ] Verify PDF generation quality

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (3 hours)
- [ ] Implement batch tip processing (50+ tips at once)
- [ ] Add tip quality scoring and filtering
- [ ] Create automated categorization system
- [ ] Enhance PDF templates with better design

### Phase 3: Integration & Automation (2 hours)
- [ ] Complete Canva API integration
- [ ] Set up automated daily tip generation
- [ ] Implement export workflows (CSV, JSON, ZIP)
- [ ] Add analytics and reporting features

### Phase 4: UI/UX Improvements (2 hours)
- [ ] Create dashboard with tip statistics
- [ ] Add bulk operations interface
- [ ] Implement search and filtering
- [ ] Add user preferences and settings

### Phase 5: Testing & Deployment (1 hour)
- [ ] Comprehensive testing of all features
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts

## Quality Standards
- All code must pass TypeScript type checking
- Components must follow existing patterns
- Database operations must use transactions where appropriate
- Error handling must be comprehensive
- All features must be tested before marking complete

## Git Workflow
- Commit every 30 minutes with descriptive messages
- Create feature branches for major changes
- Tag stable versions before risky changes
- Never leave uncommitted work for >1 hour

## Success Metrics
- System can generate 100 tips without manual intervention
- PDF generation completes in <2 seconds per tip
- Database queries execute in <100ms
- Zero TypeScript errors in production build
- All tests passing
