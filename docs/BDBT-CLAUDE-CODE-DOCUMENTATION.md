## üí° Best Practices When Using Claude Code

### 1. Clear Instructions
```markdown
Good: "Create a React component for displaying user tips with pagination, filters by category, and a search bar"
Better: "Create a TypeScript React component called TipsList that:
- Displays tips from the bdbt_tips table
- Has pagination (10 items per page)
- Filters by category (health, wealth, happiness)
- Includes a search bar that searches title and content"
```

### 2. Use Todo Lists
Claude Code automatically creates and manages todo lists for complex tasks:
```markdown
"Build a complete user dashboard with:
1. Profile management
2. Progress tracking
3. Achievement display
4. Settings panel"
```

### 3. Leverage MCP Integrations
Instead of asking Claude to write database queries, use direct MCP commands:
```markdown
"Use Supabase MCP to create a new table for user achievements with columns for user_id, achievement_id, earned_at"
```

---

## üîÑ Common Claude Code Commands for BDBT

### Database Operations
```bash
# Create new table
"Create a Supabase table for [feature] with appropriate columns and RLS policies"

# Add data
"Import the tips data from CSV into the bdbt_tips table"

# Query data
"Show me all tips in the health category with difficulty level Easy"
```

### Frontend Development
```bash
# Component creation
"Create a React component for [feature] using our existing design patterns"

# Service integration
"Create a service to fetch and cache tips from Supabase"

# State management
"Add Zustand store for managing user preferences"
```

### Documentation
```bash
# Generate docs
"Create comprehensive documentation for the tips system"

# API docs
"Document all Supabase API endpoints used in BDBT"

# User guides
"Create a user guide for the BDBT platform features"
```

## üö® Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. MCP Connection Issues
**Problem**: "MCP server not responding"
**Solution**: 
```bash
# Restart Claude Code
# Check MCP configuration in settings.json
# Verify API keys are correct
```

### 2. Database Sync Issues
**Problem**: "TypeScript types don't match database"
**Solution**:
```bash
"Regenerate TypeScript types from the current Supabase schema"
```

### 3. Build Errors
**Problem**: "Build failing due to type errors"
**Solution**:
```bash
"Fix all TypeScript errors in the build, focusing on type mismatches"
```
