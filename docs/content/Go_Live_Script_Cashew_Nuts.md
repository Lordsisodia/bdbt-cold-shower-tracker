# "Go Live" Script - Buy Cashew Nuts In Bulk

## 10-Minute Live Session Structure

### Opening (1-2 minutes)
"Hey everyone! Good to see you all here. So I'm sitting here eating cashews right now, and I realized this is literally one of the simplest tips that changed my snacking game completely. 

How many of you grab random snacks when you're hungry? Like, you're working, you get that 3 PM energy dip, and you just reach for whatever's closest? *pause for comments*

I used to do this ALL the time. I'd buy those little $4 bags of nuts at the store, or worse, I'd grab chips or candy because they were cheap and easy. But here's what I figured out..."

### The Problem (2-3 minutes)
"The problem with snacking isn't that we snack - it's that we make snack decisions when we're already hungry and tired. That's when our brains go into survival mode and we grab whatever's convenient.

*show small bag of cashews*

Look at this - $4 for maybe 20 cashews. If I eat one of these every few days, I'm spending like $60 a month on nuts alone. And that's just ONE snack!

But the real problem is what happens when you don't have good snacks ready. You grab chips, you grab candy, you grab whatever's processed and cheap. Then you feel sluggish, you crash, and you're hungry again in an hour.

Anyone else relate to this? *check comments*"

### The Solution & Story (3-4 minutes)
"So here's what I started doing - I buy cashews in bulk. Like, I go to Costco or order online and get a 3-pound bag for $15-20.

First time I did this, I thought I was crazy. Like, who needs 3 pounds of cashews? But here's what happened:

I portioned them out into small containers - took me maybe 10 minutes total. Now I have healthy snacks ready for weeks. When I get hungry, I grab cashews instead of junk.

But the real magic is what happened next. Because I had good snacks ready, I stopped making bad snack decisions. I stopped buying expensive little bags at the store. My energy stayed stable throughout the day.

*show bulk container*

This cost me $18 and will last me 6 weeks. That's like $3 a week versus $15 a week buying small bags. That's over $600 a year just on cashews alone!"

### The Benefits & Chain Reaction (2-3 minutes)
"But it's not just about money - though saving $600 a year is pretty nice, right?

Health-wise: Cashews are packed with healthy fats, protein, and magnesium. They keep you full, your energy stable, and your brain sharp. No more 3 PM crashes.

Wealth-wise: You're saving money on snacks, but more importantly, you're making better decisions. When you're not hangry, you make better choices about everything - including money.

Happiness-wise: You feel prepared, you feel good about your choices, and you're not constantly fighting with yourself about what to eat.

It's like this chain reaction: Good snacks ready → Better energy → Better decisions → More money saved → Less stress → Better mood → More productivity → Better life.

All from buying cashews in bulk!"

### Audience Interaction (1-2 minutes)
"Alright, I see some comments coming in. Let me address a few...

*respond to 2-3 comments*

What questions do you have? Anyone tried buying snacks in bulk before? What worked, what didn't?

*pause for responses*

And hey, if you're thinking 'but I don't have a Costco membership' - you can order online, go with a friend, or even check your local grocery store. Some places have bulk bins."
