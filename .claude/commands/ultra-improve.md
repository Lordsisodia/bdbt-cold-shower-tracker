# Ultra Improvement Protocol

I will now ultra-improve your request: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Phase 1: Context Gathering & Analysis
First, let me gather comprehensive context about your request by:
- Analyzing the codebase structure and relevant files
- Understanding existing patterns and conventions
- Identifying dependencies and constraints
- Mapping related components and systems

## Phase 2: Strategic Planning
Based on the context, I'll create a detailed plan that:
- Breaks down the task into optimal sub-components
- Identifies potential challenges and solutions
- Plans the most efficient execution sequence
- Considers edge cases and error handling

## Phase 3: Ultra Thinking Implementation
Now I'll apply ultra thinking to execute with:
- Deep analysis of best practices and patterns
- Optimization for performance and maintainability
- Security and quality considerations
- Future-proofing and extensibility

## Phase 4: Verification & Enhancement
Finally, I'll verify and enhance by:
- Testing the implementation thoroughly
- Running lints and type checks
- Documenting critical decisions
- Suggesting future improvements

Let me begin this ultra-improvement process for your request...
