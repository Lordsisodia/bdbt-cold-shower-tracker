# Enhance all existing agents with Telegram reporting

IMPORTANT UPDATE: You now have Telegram reporting capability.

Use this command to send updates:
./scripts/agent-telegram.sh "Your update message here"

Required updates to send:
1. When starting a new task: ./scripts/agent-telegram.sh "Starting: [task name]"
2. When completing a task: ./scripts/agent-telegram.sh "Completed: [task name]"
3. Every 30 minutes: ./scripts/agent-telegram.sh "Progress: [what you're working on]"
4. When encountering issues: ./scripts/agent-telegram.sh "Issue: [problem description]"
5. When making commits: ./scripts/agent-telegram.sh "Commit: [commit message]"

This keeps the team owner informed while they're away.
